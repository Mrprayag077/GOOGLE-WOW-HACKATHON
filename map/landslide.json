Several vehicles including some LPG gas cylinder carriers were trapped at Marhi. Seeing that damage was huge and restoration of highway was impossible at night, a truck (HP20A-8959) driver, Sukhbir Singh, 30, resident of Una, slept inside the truck and was found dead on Sunday morning. The postmortem of the deceased is yet to be carried out but sources said he died due to severe cold.  He could have been saved if landslides had not forced him to spend the night inside the truck without proper woolens. Manali DSP Shiv Chaudhary said the body was found without warm clothes inside the truck. A source stranded in the jam at Rohtang reported",

These widespread, composite flows in the over saturated slope forming materials caused 182 deaths including that of 3 foreign tourists, damaged 607 houses, breached all major communication networks to Leh town besides inflicting an unaccountable loss of livestock and agriculture fields. The disaster caused severe damage to the settlements in parts of Leh town, Sabu village, Choklamsar, Leh airport area, Nimu, Ney and Bazgo area around the town. Widespread occurrence of varied, unconsolidated Quaternary drift deposits perched over gentle to fairly steep slopes are susceptible to mass movement under conditions of heavy saturation.

The place is around 3 km from Kurseong town.  The Hills had been receiving incessant overnight rain. Apart from St Mary's Hills, a landslide swept a pick-up truck into the gorge near Dhobi Khola. In Kalimpong, NH-31A, which leads to Sikkim, remained cut off for five hours after a landslide at 27th Mile and Sethi Khola. The Border Roads Organization (BRO) later managed to resume normal vehicular services.  At St Mary's Hills, further rain hampered rescue operations. After four hours, the fire brigade and the local police managed to recover the bodies of Nashim Akhtar and his children from under the rubble. Akhtar (35), a smalltime hawker, hailed from Motihari in Bihar. He had been living in Kurseong with his family for quite some time. His 10-year-old son Md Faisal and daughters Musurut Banu (3) and three-month-old Nusurut Banu died with him. Akh",

If the monsoon showers continue with the same intensity, it is expected that the sunken portion of the highway will have to be closed as it has already become difficult for vehicles to pass through the place.  The main concern of the administrative authorities is the landslide area at the old Kohima Municipal Council (KMC) dumping site about 7 km away from the state capital where mudslides have started with the arrival of the monsoon, leading to disruption of vehicular traffic. Passengers travelling between Kohima and Dimapur have also complained that it is already taking hours to reach their destination.  ",

Monsoon rainfall in 2013 had exceeded the forecast, causing landslides and floods in several districts. Coastal erosion compounded the problem, damaging the state coastline significantly. Floods devastated several villages leading to evacuation and dislocation of a large number of families, the memorandum said. \"Out of the 1,51,652km of roads in the state, more than 50% have been severely damaged.

Some of the 17 trapped labourers were rescued by villagers while others managed to come out themselves. Two persons were crushed under the boulders. A massive rescue operation is on at the site. The lease for the stone quarry was recently renewed by competent authorities in the district and it is not illegal. Deputy commissioner Uma Shankar Singh said currently the focus of the district administration is on rescue operation. \"Two persons are trapped inside. All the alleys to the place where they are trapped have been blocked in the landslide. It would take around 20 hours for the machines to remove blockades and let us reach them,\" said Singh. The quarry area is spread over 1.5 acre land and several deep holes have been created in there. The labourers were engaged in their work when one large boulder rolled down to the deeper circles. ",

The landslides left at least 100 vehicles coming from Siliguri stranded on the Bengal-Sikkim border at Rangpo for sometime. While some passengers tried to walk and cross the slides, others returned to Siliguri. “The vehicles — there were lots of them — were told to stay put at Singtam for the night,” said A.K.

A huge portion of the hill collapsed on Eknath Chawl because of the rains. Two rooms of the ground plus one storey structure of the chawl got completely buried under debris before two families staying in those rooms could vacate it.  Local residents immediately started rescue work but ambulance and fire brigade could not reach the spot due to the hilly topography of the area. Intermittent showers also disrupted rescue work. After one and half hour, people could be rescued from debris, but six persons had died by the time.  Deceased were identified as Rima Patel, 30, Raj Patel, 5, Amit Patel, 9, Shantidevi Yadav, 30, Umesh Yadav, 34, Seema Patel, 10, and Madhuri Yadav, 8. Among the injured were Rakesh ",

The deceased were identified as M. Senthil (30), N. Nallaiyan (45), C. Muthuramalingam (45).  The bodies were taken to the Government Rajaji hospital for post-mortem. P. Sudharashan, another worker, suffered fractures on his leg after boulders fell on him.  He has been admitted to a private hospital.          Madurai Superintendent of Police, Vijayendra Bidari, who inspected the spot, said that around eight workers of the quarry were working at a height of 300 feet at the time of the incident.  “They had used compressor to drill holes on the rock for filling chemicals to blast it. However, due to the vibration caused by the drilling, the loose soil above caved in,” he said.  While four people involved in the work managed to run from the scene, earth and boulders fell on three, burying them alive.",

Apprehension hangs heavy among the people that their homesteads might be buried by the falling mud and earth.  Following heavy downpour in the last 4/5 days, mud and earth started sliding down the hill side from a spot 40 feet above the ground, said the villagers.  Because of the heavy mudslide which occurred near a rice mill, one inter-village road located beneath the hill was closed for some period.  Even as the rice mill belonging to one Md Rabi (63) was saved from the devastating effect of the mudslide by putting wooden fence around it, one hand-pump, a tube-well and a cow shed have been buried by the mudslide.  The IVR was re-opened after the villagers cleared the mound of mud and earth.  The villagers said that a similar mudslide occurred in the other side of Heibok h",

Monsoon rainfall in 2013 had exceeded the forecast, causing landslides and floods in several districts. Coastal erosion compounded the problem, damaging the state coastline significantly. Floods devastated several villages leading to evacuation and dislocation of a large number of families, the memorandum said. \"Out of the 1,51,652km of roads in the state, more than 50% have been severely damaged.

Official sources said the yatra is disrupted as the repair work on the damaged Gaurikund-Kedarnath trek is still going on. The PWD is making efforts to resume the movement of pilgrims on trek which is blocked since Friday when landslides hit the trek damaging it. However, they said, it might take a couple of days more to make the trek fit for movement of pilgrims. The alternative trek route to Kedarnath is very narrow making it dangerous for pilgrims to use it, they added. Kedarnath, which is among the four Himalayan shrines collectively known as Chardham, is situated at a height of 3581 meter in Garhwal Himalayas. The shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva.",

Our source says, “As soon as the unit left for the location, which is near the Rohtang Pass; the production crew almost got caught in a landslide. They immediately alerted the rest of the unit and an alternative location was selected.  But as soon as they were heading back to the second location, another landslide left them trapped in between the two landslides. Vipul Shah then realised that it was a serious situation.  Finally army had to be called to evacuate them. The condition in Manali is in fact so bad that the unit cannot pre-plan anything. ",

Journey to places like Mimi in Kiphire, Pangsha in Tuensang and parts of Mon and Peren can be made only on four wheel drive vehicles or on foot. Mud slides are common in almost all the highways leading to district headquarters. Exploitation of natural resources like boulders and deforestation is causing more landslides than before.

Frequent landslides between Manali and Rohtang interrupted vehicular movement for many hours on Friday. Although Border Roads Organization (BRO) is working hard to stem landslides using available techniques, these have proved inadequate. While some vehicles dared to cross the damaged stretch, others preferred to return. As weatherman has predicted more rains during the next 48 hours, the ``sinking zone\" near Rohtang is believed to be badly damaged. With fear of stranding at Rohtang, tourists have preferred not to go there, sources said.

Around 7am, huge stones, along with mud soil, came sliding down and fell on the five houses.”    On Tuesday, the families of those living in those houses were moved out, after the Bhiwandi Nizampura Municipal corporation (BNMC) issued notices to them.  An official from the BNMC said,”We had given them a notice about the landslide. We are verifying residents’ claims. If we find any truth, a case will be filed.”  A Bhiwandi city police station police officer said, “No case has been filed. The clearing of debris is going on.”",

However, Sasi had moved the belongings in the shop in the morning as informed by the local people.
